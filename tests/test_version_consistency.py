"""Guard against version drift between pyproject.toml and __init__.py.

Same known recurring bug class already fixed and guarded against
fleet-wide (see reboot-safety-check, usbsmart-doctor): a release can
bump pyproject.toml's [project].version while leaving __init__.py's
__version__ stale, so the wheel's package metadata and the CLI's own
--version output disagree. Applied here proactively before it ever
happens, not after.
